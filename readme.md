# Graph Traversal Interview Question Ruby Implementation

### Description
The local commuter railroad services a number of towns in Kiwiland.  Because of monetary concerns, all of the tracks are 'one-wayâ€™. That is, a route from Kaitaia to Invercargill does not imply the existence of a route from Invercargill to Kaitaia. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance!

The purpose of this problem is to help the railroad provide its customers with information about the routes. In particular, you will compute the distance along a certain route, the number of different routes between two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.

Input: A directed graph where a node represents a town and an edge represents a route between two towns. The weighting of the edge represents the distance between the two towns. A given route will never appear more than once, and for a given route, the starting and ending town will not be the same town.

Output: For test input 1 through 5, if no such route exists, output 'NO SUCH ROUTE'. Otherwise, follow the route as given; do not make any extra stops! For example, the first problem means to start at city A, then travel directly to city B (a distance of 5), then directly to city C (a distance of 4).

1. The distance of the route A-B-C.
2. The distance of the route A-D.
3. The distance of the route A-D-C.
4. The distance of the route A-E-B-C-D.
5. The distance of the route A-E-D.
6. The number of trips starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3 stops.  In the sample data below, there are two such trips: C-D-C (2 stops). and C-E-B-C (3 stops).
7. The number of trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops.  In the sample data below, there are three such trips: A to C (via B,C,D); A to C (via D,C,D); and A to C (via D,E,B).
8. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from A to C.
9. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from B to B.
10. The number of different routes from C to C with a distance of less than 30.  In the sample data, the trips are: CDC, CEBC, CEBCDC, CDCEBC, CDEBC, CEBCEBC, CEBCEBCEBC.

Test Input:
For the test input, the towns are named using the first few letters of the alphabet from A to D. A route between two towns (A to B) with a distance of 5 is represented as AB5.

Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7

Expected Output:
Output #1: 9
Output #2: 5
Output #3: 13
Output #4: 22
Output #5: NO SUCH ROUTE
Output #6: 2
Output #7: 3
Output #8: 9
Output #9: 9
Output #10: 7

 - There must be a way to supply the application with the input data via text file.
 - The application must run and you should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data.
 - The submission should be production quality and it can be done in any language (using JavaScript, CoffeeScript or Ruby would be a bonus).
 - You may not use any external libraries to solve this problem, but you may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes. Specifically, you may use unit testing libraries or build tools available for your chosen language.


### Discussion

 This is apparently a common thoughtworks interview question to see if you know graph traversal algorithms. This solution is not very well optimized but it should get the job done. In general the idea is to 
* Get the graph read into a adjacency matrix
* Generate a list of the different paths based on neighboring nodes to a source node. Depending on the application you can use a BFS to find short routes, but it seems like you kinda have to exhaustively search all the options because a lot of these questions are asking you to sort from the set of all routes. 

 #### Points to optimize:

 * Replace all the loops with Enumerable 
 * Prune out certain steps on specific conditions e.g. for Q10 if a path already exceeds 30 length at stop 2, there's no need to check it's neighbors any further. 


### Environments
Code was developed on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64 but should work on any machine with Ruby 2.0+
###System Dependencies and Config:
* ruby => 2.0
* rspec => 3.3.2 (for testing)
* pretty print for outputs

### Installation
Assuming you have the relevant dependencies installed, there is no additional installation needed.
### Operation 
`ruby graph_wrapper.rb test.data` 

### Testing
`rspec graph_spec.rb`
